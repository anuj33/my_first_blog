        Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a digital
        payment system invented by an unknown programmer, or a group
        of programmers, under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It was released as
        open-source software in 2009.

        The system is peer-to-peer, and transactions take place between users
        directly, without an intermediary These transactions are verified by
        network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger .Since the system
        works without a central repository oringle administrator, bitcoin is called
        the first decentralized digital currency.[

            Number of unspent transaction outputs
            The blockchain is a public ledger that records bitcoin
            transactions.[28] A novel solution accomplishes this without
            any trusted central authority: maintenance of the blockchain is performed
            by a network of communicating nodes running bitcoin software.[13] Transactions
            of the form payer X sends Y bitcoins to payee Z are broadcast to this network
            using readily available software applications.[29] Network nodes can validate
            transactions, add them to their copy of the ledger, and then broadcast these l
            edger additions to other nodes. The blockchain is a distributed database – to
            achieve independent verification of the chain of ownership of any and every

            bitcoin amount, each network node stores its own copy of the blockchain.[30]
            Approximately six times per hour, a new group of accepted transactions
            , a block, is created, added to the blockchain, and quickly published to all nodes
